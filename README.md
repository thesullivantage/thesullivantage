👋 Hi, I’m @thesullivantage (Jack Sullivan)

👀 I’m interested in... all things science, technology, and mathematics. 

🌱 I’m currently honing my skills in C++ and learning more about the ancient atmosphere of Mars before it was blown away by solar winds.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Web Development Projects for hire, or scientific research in any capacity!
